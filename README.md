The bacf website is a personal project I built to explore modern web development and hosting. It serves as a dynamic web application where I can manage posts, connect with Firebase services, and experiment with responsive front-end and back-end design.

This project is hosted on Render (server deployment) and integrates with Firebase for authentication, database, and storage.
